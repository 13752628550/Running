    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team = players;
    // team[3]="05433CF1.png";
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[2]="pingguo";
    const team3 = Array.from(players);
    team3[3]="orange";

    const team5 = [].concat(players);
    team5[3] = "daxigua";
    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    const dev= person;
    // dev.name= "xianggua";

    const dev2 = Object.assign({},person,{name:'pingguo'});

    const dev3 ={...person};
    dev3.name = "putaoguo";


    const author = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    const au2 = Object.assign({},author);
    au2.name ="hahahahahaha";
    au2.social.twitter="microsoft";

    const au3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(author));
    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
